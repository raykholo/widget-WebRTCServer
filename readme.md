# widget-empty

This is the bare minimum code required to inline separate html, css, and js files into one auto-generated-widget.html

A video tutorial is available [here](https://youtu.be/7D1qPwtLIH0).

If you would like to move from JSFiddle to Github/Cloud9, replace url and fiddleurl properties inside the javascript cpdefine with and add these others as well:

```
		url: "(auto fill by runme.js)",       // The final URL of the working widget as a single HTML file with CSS and Javascript inlined. You can let runme.js auto fill this if you are using Cloud9.
        fiddleurl: "(auto fill by runme.js)", // The edit URL. This can be auto-filled by runme.js in Cloud9 if you'd like, or just define it on your own to help people know where they can edit/fork your widget
        githuburl: "(auto fill by runme.js)", // The backing github repo
        testurl: "(auto fill by runme.js)",   // The standalone working widget so can view it working by itself
```
